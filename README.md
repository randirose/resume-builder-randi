- View and add previous jobs (work history)  
- View and add skills  
- View and add education/certificates  
- Remove jobs/skills/certificates  
- Download a PDF version of their resume to use when applying to jobs  

## User Story

AS A member of the workforce and a job searcher,  
I WANT to have an easy way to continuously add and remove jobs, skills, and education/certificates from a formatted resume,  
SO THAT I can easily apply to multiple jobs with a nice looking resume, and,  
SO THAT I can easily edit or adjust my resume on a continuous basis throughout my career.  

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a full-stack application using a GraphQL database to store my work history  
WHEN I load the app  
THEN I am presented with a home page to login or sign up  
WHEN I enter in all the fields and sign up  
THEN I am presented with my empty profile page  
WHEN I add a job, skill, or education/certificate using the provided forms  
THEN I am able to see the list of the corresponding category to the left of the form (or on top if on mobile)  
WHEN I click the `Preview/Download` option in the nav bar  
THEN I am presented with a preview of my formatted resume  
WHEN I click on the `Download` button  
THEN my resume is downloaded in PDF format  
WHEN I go back to my profile page, I can add or remove additional jobs/skills/certs  
THEN those changes are reflected in my downloadable PDF resume!

## Future Development

- Edit user & job functionality: edit user info, deactivate jobs for job-specific customization  
- Create multiple resume templates for user to choose from  
- Implement additional validation (right now, validation is minimal to allow for formatting/customization)  
- LinkedIn integration: Pull in LinkedIn info (LinkedIn has a resume builder, but the formatting isnâ€™t spectacular)
